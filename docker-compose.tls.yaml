#
# Docker Compose override for TLS-enabled development
# Use this to test ACME clients that expect HTTPS (like example clients)
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.tls.yaml up -d
#
# Or set COMPOSE_FILE environment variable:
#   export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yaml:docker-compose.tls.yaml
#   docker-compose up -d
#

services:
  serles:
    ports:
      - "8443:8443" # HTTPS with self-signed certificate
    environment:
      TLS_ENABLED: "true"
      TLS_PORT: "8443"
      TLS_CERT_FILE: "/etc/serles/tls/server.crt"
      TLS_KEY_FILE: "/etc/serles/tls/server.key"
